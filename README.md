# Ashish's 3D Personal Website 🌐

Welcome to my 3D personal website! This interactive project allows visitors to explore a floating island in 3D, with a character that can roam freely across different sections. The website is built using modern web technologies like Vite, React Three Fiber (R3F), and Rapier for physics. The project is still in development, with new features and enhancements planned for the future.

## Project Overview 🏝️

- **3D Environment**: The website is presented as a floating island with interactive elements.
- **Character Exploration**: A character can run around and explore the various parts of the island, which feature paths, buildings, and trees.
- **Physics**: Built with Rapier to bring realistic physics and interactions to the 3D environment.
- **Built With**: 
  - **Vite** for fast development and optimized build process.
  - **React Three Fiber (R3F)** to create and manage 3D scenes with React.
  - **React** as the base framework.

## Features 🚀

- **Interactive Exploration**: Users can navigate through a 3D world by controlling a character that explores the island.
- **Custom Design**: The island features custom-designed paths, trees, buildings, and water elements to make it visually engaging.
- **University and Career Highlights**: Some sections highlight important information like my affiliation with the University of Toronto and my interest areas in Computer Graphics, AI, and Research.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Vite** - Development and build tool for optimized web projects.
- **React Three Fiber** - A React renderer for Three.js, allowing seamless 3D rendering with React components.
- **Rapier** - A physics engine for simulating realistic movements and interactions in the 3D space.
